# coffee-machine

A [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) coffee machine

## Development Mode

### Start Cider from Emacs:

Put this in your Emacs config file:

```
(setq cider-cljs-lein-repl
	"(do (require 'figwheel-sidecar.repl-api)
         (figwheel-sidecar.repl-api/start-figwheel!)
         (figwheel-sidecar.repl-api/cljs-repl))")
```

Navigate to a clojurescript file and start a figwheel REPL with `cider-jack-in-clojurescript` or (`C-c M-J`)

### Compile css:

Compile css file once.

```
lein garden once
```

Automatically recompile css file on change.

```
lein garden auto
```

### Run application:

```
lein clean
lein figwheel dev
```

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Production Build

```
lein clean
lein uberjar
```

That should compile the clojurescript code first, and then create the standalone jar.

When you run the jar you can set the port the ring server will use by setting the environment variable PORT.
If it's not set, it will run on port 3000 by default.

To compile clojurescript to javascript:

```
lein clean
lein cljsbuild once min
```
